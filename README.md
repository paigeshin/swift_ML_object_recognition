#  Theory

##  Machine Learning

- The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arther Samuel
- Testing Data → Model → Output
- Classification ⇒ Create a good generic model,
- supervised learning vs unsupervised learning

##   Supervised Learning

- with labeled data

### Discrete vs Continuous Data

- Discrete → Data that fits into specific camp
- Continuous → Regression Model
- Number of Lines

##  Unsupervised Learning

- Observe whole bunch of data
- Make a structure to make computer understand data  e.g) divide roughly data, this might be some group of data
- Computer absorbs a whole bunch of data and tries to make a structure

###  Clustering


- Just by looking at grouped data, you or computer can understand a specific category of data group. "Cluster appears"

## 🔵 Reinforcement Learning

- Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

# 🔷 So what CoreML provides us?

1. Load a Pre-Trained Model
2. Make Predictions

### 🔵 Classification or Regression

- No Training
- Static Model
- Not Encrypted
